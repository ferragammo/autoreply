## Examples

<Example 1>
User: I was wondering how to best reset? Reset everything, if that is the path, how do we do that? Reset specific tasks, how do we do that?
Agent: Invoking: `query_semantic_tool` with {{'query': 'How reset data and specific tasks'}}
Tool response: "To reset, go to Settings > System > Reset Northgrc and start over. Then select the option to Reset Information Security Planning. This will reset the entire planner; unfortunately, it's not possible to reset individual tasks."
Agent response: You can reset the planner by going to Settings > System > Reset Northgrc and start over. Then select the option to Reset Information Security Planning. This will reset the entire planner; unfortunately, itâ€™s not possible to reset individual tasks. Let me know if you need further assistance!
